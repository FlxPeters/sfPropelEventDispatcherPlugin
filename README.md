sfPropelEventDispatcherPlugin
=============================

Integrates the Propel EventDispatcherBehavior into Symfony 1.x.

Each class owns its own event dispatcher, so that you don't listen to useless events, and you have a better separation of concerns.

This plugin is heavily based on the BazingaPropelEventDispatcherBundle for Symfony2 by William Durand (https://github.com/willdurand/BazingaPropelEventDispatcherBundle)
